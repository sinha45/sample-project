        <p>I always try to understand the flow before doing any change or while debugging issues. Once you know
            workflow like where is the input coming from, where is the logic and data, and how the response is
            returned makes a lot of difference in your day-to-day work.It is a long established fact that a reader 
            will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem 
            Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, 
            content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors 
            now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites 
            still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on 
            purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
