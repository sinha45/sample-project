            <p>We’re all on a journey, and we’ve all been down in the dumps before, wondering if what we’re doing is
                really
                worth it.

                Wondering if what we’re doing is really making an impact.

                But, it’s important that we’re always moving forward. This is a lesson that I learned early in life.</p>

                <h2 class="left-side">Mission</h2>
                <p class="left-side">Not to be confused with a vision statement, a mission statement is a brief
                    description of an
                    organization’s
                    purpose and how it serves audiences through the types of products or services it provides them with.
                    It
                    may
                    also
                    include your core values, philosophies or goals, all of which can help to reflect your uniqueness
                    and
                    what
                    sets
                    your business apart from others. </p>

                <p class="left-side">“Our vision is to create a better everyday life for many people.” That's
                    aspirational, short and to
                    the
                    point. More than that, it sets the tone for the company and makes it clear that they're in the
                    market to
                    offer low-priced good furnishings that suit everyone's lifestyle</p>

                <h2 class="left-side">Goals</h2>
                <p class="left-side">The ultimate goal of Design is to give you time. Look at the objects around you.
                    When you trace back
                    every
                    (well
                    designed) object and disassemble it to various fragments of functionality and effects it has, you
                    will
                    always
                    find fragments labeled “I save time for you”. A lot of things cause time saving.</p>

            <p>This is the situation of many programmers and web developers out there, but updating yourself and
                keeping pace with the technology is not really easy. It’s much easier said than done.

            <p>I always try to understand the flow before doing any change or while debugging issues. Once you know
                workflow like where is the input coming from, where is the logic and data, and how the response is
                returned makes a lot of difference in your day-to-day work.</p>
